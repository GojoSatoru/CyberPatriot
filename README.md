# CyberPatriot
Linux_bash_scripts


Dear Person reading these,

Thes are for the Cyber Patriot competition scenario that is for people through K-12.
First, one should that these are NOT 4 YOUR USE!~
But only to learn from.

In the event that you do use these to sweep through competition after competition, I will remove them.

Please, do us all a favor and ONLY use these to learn from, please don't copy and past like any other script kitty out there.
